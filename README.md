## Introduction

A calendar app made for the second challenge in my application for the 2018 Spotify Fellowship.

## Deployment

A deployed version of this app can be found [here]. It is running with a single dyno so it may take a few seconds to load.

## Installation

Run the following commands to build the app locally. A recent version of npm and nodemon is required.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

The app will be found at http://localhost:3000
