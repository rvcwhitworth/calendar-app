# Calendar App

## Introduction

A calendar app made for the second challenge in my application for the 2018 Spotify Fellowship. There are three views available: month, week, and day. New events can be created by clicking on the day, and events can be updated or deleted by clicking on them.

## Deployment

A deployed version of this app can be found [here]. It is running with a single dyno so it may take a few seconds to load.

## Installation

A recent version of npm and Node.js is required. Run the following command from the root directory to build the app locally.

```sh
$ npm start
```

The app will be found at http://localhost:3000
